# Sumplete

Sumplete is a simple javascript game, a clone of [Sumplete](https://sumplete.com/).

This project was created as a demonstration of what you can do with plain javascript and bulma css, and was given as an assignment for my 12th grade IT students. (Penultimate year of high school in Italy)

You can access the game [here](https://sumplete.stecca.dev/).

## How to play

- The sum of the numbers in each row and column must be the same.
- Clicking one time on a number will mark it as valid.
- Clicking a second time will mark it as invalid.
- Clicking a third time will remove the mark. (Game only checks invalid marks)
